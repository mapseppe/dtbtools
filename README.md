This Web Application is used to visualize changes between original situation and the situation after making edits to it, in the form of a web map.  
By uploading the 'before' and 'after' situation of a similar shapefile or geodatabase, this app generates a new map that shows which features are new, deleted and changed in geometry.  
This can then be easily shared with others through an url.  
It is specifically created and configured for the Digitaal Topografisch Bestand (DTB).
